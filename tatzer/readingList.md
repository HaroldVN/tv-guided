- [x] **The Richest Man in Babylon** by _George S. Clason_  
  A strong introduction to personal finance, following narratives set in ancient Babylon.
- [x] **The Energy Bus** by _Jon Gordon_  
  Not a book that I can suggest with any sincerity. The whole book felt disingenuous, in part because the book keeps referring back to their shoddy website. Has some valid points, but nothing that can't be learned more earnestly from other sources.
- [x] **Triggers** by _Marshall Goldsmith_  
  Discusses how one's environment impacts one's behavior, and gives advice on how to counteract negative influences.
- [x] **The Like Switch** by _Jack Shafer_ and _Marvin Karlins_  
  A decent introduction to various bits of charisma, such as body language, speech cues, and conversational flow, but doesn't go into any significant depth and uses far too much anecdotal evidence for my liking. Sputters out in the later half of the book.
